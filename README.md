Associative Arrays
==================

Author: Lucas Willett

Received help from Simon the evening tutor - helped me figure out how to deal with checking for keys that also may be null by using a few && 
in the if statements
207 website - gave us instructions and pieces to create for our class
SamR - gave us the skeleton class of AssociativeArray with the fields and constructors and the expected methods as stubs

This is a way to organize data as a dictionary of sorts. Data will be stored in key/value pairs in an expandable array. We can get, set (either add or override an existing key), remove and print from these arrays. The arrays can be set with any types for both the keys and values.
